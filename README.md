I will be building a four function calculator web app using html, css, and javascript.

In this project, I learned how to use event listeners to make a functioning calculator, using both clickable buttons and the keyboard.
I struggled the most with the button event listeners, and working through the logic to add numbers and make sure they all worked correctly.
